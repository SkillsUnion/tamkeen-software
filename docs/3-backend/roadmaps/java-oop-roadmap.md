# Module Roadmap

---

The following roadmap shows all the major topics that will covered in this module.

## **1. Class Attributes And Methods**

### **Lesson Objective:**

Understand the concept and use cases of classes in Java, differentiate between classes and objects, explore accessor methods and their uniqueness, and gain practical experience by creating classes, instantiating objects, and implementing private properties with accessor methods.


## **2. Constructors**

### **Lesson Objective:**
 
Understand the role and functionality of constructors in initializing objects in Java, implement default and parameterized constructors, explore constructor overloading by creating multiple constructors with different parameter lists, and apply the `this` keyword to distinguish between instance variables and constructor parameters.


## **3. Accessor Mutator Methods**

### **Lesson Objective:**  

Learn to encapsulate class data in Java by using private fields and effectively access and modify their values through accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods.

## **4. Static Kayword And POJO**

### **Lesson Objective:**  

Understand the role of the `static` keyword in Java for variables, methods, and blocks, declare and access static members in classes, override the `toString()` method, and explore the concept and significance of POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) in simplifying object-oriented programming.


## **5.Encapsulation**

### **Lesson Objective:** 
 
Understand encapsulation in Java and its role in improving data security and abstraction, explore the use of access modifiers (private, public, protected, default), implement getter and setter methods to control field access, and write a class that encapsulates its fields using private access modifiers.


## **6. Inheritence**

### **Lesson Objective:** 

Understand inheritance in object-oriented programming, the "is-a" relationship between parent (superclass) and child (subclass) classes, and the use of the `extends` keyword to inherit from a superclass. Explore access levels (private, protected, public) in the context of inheritance, and use the `super` keyword to call superclass constructors and methods.


## **7. Polymorphism**

### **Lesson Objective:** 
 
Understand polymorphism and its significance in object-oriented programming (OOP), distinguish between compile-time (static) and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism, and explore method overloading as a form of compile-time polymorphism and method overriding as a form of runtime polymorphism.

## **8.  Abstraction**

### **Lesson Objective:** 

Understand the concept of abstraction and the role of abstract classes and interfaces in achieving it in Java. Implement abstract classes, define abstract methods, and explore how to extend and use abstract classes. Additionally, learn about the use of default methods in interfaces (introduced in Java 8).
