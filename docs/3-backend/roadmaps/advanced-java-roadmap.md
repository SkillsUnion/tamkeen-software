# Module Roadmap

---

The following roadmap shows all the major topics that will covered in this module.

## **1. Exceptions**

### **Lesson Objective:**

Define what an exception is and understand its role in managing errors during program execution. Explore how exceptions propagate through the call stack and learn about different approaches to handle exceptions effectively.


## **2. Try-Catch-Finally**

### **Lesson Objective:**
 
Define the purpose and syntax of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, and learn how to use them to manage exceptions effectively in Java.


## **3. Checked UnChecked Exceptions**

### **Lesson Objective:**  

Understand the difference between checked (compile-time) and unchecked (runtime) exceptions. Learn how to handle checked exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, and explore the purpose of the `throws` clause in method declarations for propagating checked exceptions.
.

## **4. Custom Exceptions**

### **Lesson Objective:**  

Define generic and specific exceptions, understanding how specific exceptions target particular error conditions while generic exceptions handle a broader range of errors. Learn the process of creating custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` or `RuntimeException` class, and how to throw custom exceptions using the `throw` keyword.
