## **4. Wrapper Classes in Java**

### **Lesson Objective:**
Understand the role of wrapper classes in Java, including how they enable the conversion of primitive data types into objects (boxing) and the reverse process of converting wrapper objects back to primitive types (unboxing).

- **Auto Boxing and Unboxing:** Learn how wrapper classes in Java enable boxing (primitive to object) and unboxing (object to primitive) conversions.

## **5. Reading User Input**

### **Lesson Objective:**

Learn to use the Scanner and Console classes in Java to capture user input.

- **Scanner Class:**  Master the use of the Scanner class in Java to read user input from the console.
