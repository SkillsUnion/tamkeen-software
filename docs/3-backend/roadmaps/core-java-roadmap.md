# Module Roadmap

---

The following roadmap shows all the major topics that will covered in this module.

## **1. Operators**

### **Lesson Objective:**

Gain a comprehensive understanding of Java operators, including their categories (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical), usage, and the concepts of operator precedence and associativity, to effectively perform and evaluate operations in programming.


## **2. Control Flow Statements**

### **Lesson Objective:**
 
Understand and implement various control flow mechanisms in Java, including sequential execution, conditional statements (if, if-else, switch), iterative constructs (for, while, do-while), and flow control modifiers (break and continue), to manage program execution effectively.


## **3. Arrays**
### **Lesson Objective:**  

Understand how to declare, initialize, and access arrays in Java, perform basic operations like sorting and searching, and utilize utility methods to copy arrays efficiently.


## **4. ArrayLists**
### **Lesson Objective:**  

Understand the dynamic nature of ArrayList, explore various initialization techniques, and utilize common ArrayList methods effectively in Java programming.


## **5.Loop Through Arrays And ArrayLists**

### **Lesson Objective:** 

Learn and apply effective iteration techniques for processing data in Java Collections and Arrays, utilizing index-based loops and enhanced for-each loops. 


## **6. Packages**
### **Lesson Objective:** 

Understand how to organize Java classes and interfaces using packages, and explore both built-in and user-defined packages.


## **7. Methods**
### **Lesson Objective:** 
 
Understand how to define and call methods in Java, including the components of a method signature (return type, method name, parameters), and work with return types to handle values of both primitive types and objects.
