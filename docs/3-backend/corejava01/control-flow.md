# Control Flow Statements

## Lesson Objectives

- Learn differences between sequential execution, conditional , and iterative control flow in Java.

- Implement Conditional Statements :if, if-else, switch in Java programs.

- Use looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while to execute repetitive tasks in Java.

- Use Break and Continue Statements to control the flow within loops and switch cases.

## Introduction

Control flow or conditional statements allow programs alter their outputs given different inputs.

The control flow statements:

### 1. Decision Making Statements

- if else
- switch

### 2. Loop Statements

- for
- while / do while

### 3. Jump/Branching Statements

- break
- continue

### Create `LearnControlFlow.java` and Code Along

```java
public class LearnControlFlow {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int budget = 1000;
    int expense = 90;
  }

}
```

## `if else`:

```java
if(budget > expense) {
  System.out.println("You are within budget");
} else {
  System.out.println("You are over budget");
}
```

### `if else if`:

```java
int score = 70;

if(score > 90) {
  System.out.println("A");
} else if (score > 80) {
  System.out.println("B");
} else if (score > 70) {
  System.out.println("C");
} else if (score > 60) {
  System.out.println("D");
} else {
  System.out.println("F");
}
```

### Nested `if else`:

`if else` can be nested if needed.

```java
int age = 20;
int weight = 120;

if(age > 18) {
  if(weight > 100) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to donate blood");
  } else {
    System.out.println("You are not eligible to donate blood");
  }
} else {
  System.out.println("You are not eligible to donate blood");
}
```

## On Comparing `String` Variables :

Because the `String` is not a primitive type, when comparing `String` variables, you should use the `equals()` method instead of the `==` operator.

In Java, the `==` operator compares the memory addresses of the two objects, while the `equals()` method compares the values of the two objects.

We can test this out in JShell.

```java
String myFruit = "apple";
String hisFruit = new String("apple"); // this creates a new reference

myFruit == hisFruit; // false because different memory addresses
myFruit.equals(hisFruit); // true because commparing the contents
```

## `for` Loop :

The `for`, `while` and `do while` statements are used for looping i.e. to execute a block of code repeatedly.

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println("i: " + i);
}
```

## `while` Loop :

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.

```java
boolean isRunning = true;
int i = 0;
while (isRunning) {
  System.out.println("i: " + i);
  if (i == 5) {
    isRunning = false;
  }
  i++;
}
```

## `do while` Loop :

The difference between `while` and `do while` is that the `do while` loop will always execute the code block at least once, even if the condition is false.

```java
boolean isRunning = false;
int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println("i: " + i);
  if (i == 5) {
    isRunning = false;
  }
  i++;
} while (isRunning);
```

## `break` and `continue` :

The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop. It is usually used with an `if` statement.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    break;
    // The code below will not be executed and the loop will terminate
  }
  System.out.println("i: " + i);
}
```

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 5) {
    continue;
    // The code below will not be executed and the loop will continue with the next iteration
  }
  System.out.println("i: " + i);
}
```

## `switch` Statement :

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. It is similar to `if else` but is more concise when there are many conditions.

Create a new file `LearnSwitch.java`.

```java
public class LearnSwitch {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    String direction = "N";

    switch (direction) {
    case "N":
      System.out.println("You have chosen North");
      break;
    case "E":
      System.out.println("You have chosen East");
      break;
    case "W":
      System.out.println("You have chosen West");
      break;
    case "S":
      System.out.println("You have chosen South");
      break;
    default:
      System.out.println("Invalid input");
    }
  }
}
```

### The `break` statement is used to terminate a `case` statement. 

### `default` is used to specify the code to run if there is no case match.

Note that the `switch` statement can only be used with the following data types: `byte`, `short`, `char`, `int`, `String` a For other data types, you must use `if else` statements.

Multiple `case` statements can be combined too.

```java
switch (direction) {
  case "N":
  case "E":
  case "W":
  case "S":
    System.out.println("You have chosen a valid direction");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Invalid input");
}
```

Another example of combining multiple cases:

```java
String month = "January";
String selectedQuarter = "";

switch (month) {
  case "January":
  case "February":
  case "March":
    selectedQuarter = "Q1";
    break;
  case "April":
  case "May":
  case "June":
    selectedQuarter = "Q2";
    break;
  case "July":
  case "August":
  case "September":
    selectedQuarter = "Q3";
    break;
  case "October":
  case "November":
  case "December":
    selectedQuarter = "Q4";
    break;
  default:
    selectedQuarter = "Unknown";

}
```

## Enhanced `switch` Statement

The enhanced `switch` statement, also known as a **switch expression**, was introduced in JDK 14. It is more concise than the traditional `switch` statement. If you are using earlier versions of Java, you should use the traditional `switch` statement.

We can modify the earlier example to use the enhanced `switch` statement.

```java
switch (direction) {
  case "N" -> System.out.println("You have chosen North");
  case "E" -> System.out.println("You have chosen East");
  case "W" -> System.out.println("You have chosen West");
  case "S" -> System.out.println("You have chosen South");
  default -> System.out.println("Invalid input");
}
```

The main differences are:

- The `case` statements are now written as `case value -> statement`.
- The `break` statement is no longer needed.
- The `default` statement is now written as `default -> statement`.

As with the traditional switch statement, cases can be combined as well.

```java
switch (direction) {
  case "N", "E", "W", "S" -> System.out.println("You have chosen a valid direction");
  default -> System.out.println("Invalid input");
}
```

The `switch` expression can return the value directly as well. Using the month example from above:

```java
String quarter = switch (month) {
  case "January", "February", "March" -> "Q1";
  case "April", "May", "June" -> "Q2";
  case "July", "August", "September" -> "Q3";
  case "October", "November", "December" -> "Q4";
  default -> "Unknown";
};

System.out.println("quarter: " + quarter);
```

To customize our return value, we can use the `yield` keyword.

```java
int ratingScore = 6;

String rating = switch (ratingScore) {
  case 1, 2, 3 -> "Bad";
  case 4 -> "OK";
  case 5 -> "Good";
  default -> {
    // return keyword does not work here
    // return ratingScore + " is not a valid rating score";
    yield ratingScore + " is not a valid rating score";
  }
};

System.out.println("rating is : " + rating);
```
