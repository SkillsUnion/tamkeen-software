# Instructions for Spring Boot Assignment: Product-CRUD

## üîπ Git Instructions for Assignment Submission  

### **üìå Important: Fork and Clone Only Once**  
- You will be working on the **same GitHub repository** for all Spring Boot assignments, since we will be working on building up the same Product Managemet App.  
- **Fork and clone the repository only once while attempting the first Spring Boot assignment: _Spring Boot Assignment: Product-CRUD_.**  
- **Do not fork and clone the repository again** for each assignment‚Äîthis will overwrite your previous work and cause you to lose progress.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository (Only Once)  
Before starting the first assignment, **fork** the instructor's repository **once** and clone it to your computer:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fork the instructor's repository** on GitHub by clicking the **Fork** button.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine using this command:


###  Fork and clone a copy of <a href="https://github.com/SkillsUnion/product-crud-assignment.git" target="_blank">product-crud-assignment repo</a>


This downloads the project to your computer.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Work on Assignments in the Same Repository  
- Each new assignment will **build on your previous work**.
- Instead of forking and cloning again, **just make the required changes for each assignment** and commit them.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Save Your Work (Commit and Push)  
After completing an assignment, save your work using these commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed Assignment X - [Assignment Name]"
git push origin main
```

üîπ **Example:**  
If you're working on **Assignment 2**, you can commit like this:

```bash
git commit -m "Completed Assignment 2 - Spring Security"
git push origin main
```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Submit Your Assignment  
After pushing your changes to GitHub, submit the **GitHub repository link** (not a branch link):

---

## Remember 
‚úÖ **Do not fork and clone again** after the first time.  
‚úÖ **Always push to `main`**, since all assignments build on the same project.  
‚úÖ **Make sure your work is committed and pushed before submission.**
