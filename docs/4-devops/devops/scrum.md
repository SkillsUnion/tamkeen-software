# Agile and Scrum

## Learning Objectives
1. Describe what Agile is and what the different Agile methdologies are
2. Describe what Scrum is and know what artifacts and events are related to Scrum

## What is Agile?

Back then, projects were done using the **Waterfall methodology**, which would follow the following steps: Requirements -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Deploy -> Maintenance

One problem that companies and developers had with this methodology is that the requirements are fixed at the start of the project and with the rapid growth of technology, this means that the initial fixed requirements might be obsolete by the time the product is released. 

In order to solve this problem, developers met up in 2001 and developed a [*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*](https://agilemanifesto.org/). This manifesto aimed to improve the way teams worked to do the best for the "customer" and deliver something timely and tangible and "as promised".

### Values of Agile

There are 4 concepts that Agile values:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over *processes and tools*
2. **Working software** over *comprehensive documentation*
3. **Customer collaboration** over *contract negotiation*
4. **Responding to change** over *following a plan* 

While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Principles of Agile

In order to provide value to the customers, developers would follow these principles:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. **Business people and developers must work together** daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity** -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Agile Methodologies

In order for developers to pursue the Agile mindset, they have created different methodologies that provide a robust framework for managing projects that need adapatability and responsiveness.

Here are some of the commonly used Agile methodologies:
1. Scrum: Focuses on delivering work in short sprints (typically 2-4 weeks) with defined roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner and defined events like Sprint Planning and Retrospective.
2. Kanban: Visualizes workflow using a Kanban board to manage tasks by assigning them to various statuses and improve efficiency by limiting work in progress.
3. Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasizes technical excellence and frequent releases in short cycles to improve software quality, this is typical used with Pair Programming.
4. Lean Software Development: Aims to eliminate waste and deliver value more efficiently by streamlining processes.

## Scrum

[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) is one of the most popular Agile methodologies. It focuses on the setting up a constant cadence of activities and artifacts that allow teams to deliver products at a constant pace. It is an empirical process, where decisions are based on observation, experience, and experimentation. 

Scrum has three pillars: 
1. Transparency - centers on open and unobstructed communication and is the core of trust of collaboration.
2. Inspection - revolves around consistent evaluation and review where deviations can be identified through regular assessments thus fostering improvement.
3. Adaptation - goes hand-in-hand with inspection. Once the team has inspected the product and process, they adapt their strategies based on the insights gained.

And built upon these pillars are the values of:
1. Courage - Members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems
2. Focus - Focus on the work of the Sprint and goals of the Scrum team
3. Commitment - Members personally commit to achieving the goals of the team
4. Respect - Members respect each other to be capable, independent people
5. Openness - The team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and challenges encountered

### Scrum Team

A scrum team is a small team dedicated to delivering committed product increments. The team consists of the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and Developer team. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, having all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. The Scrum team are also self-managing, meaning they decide who does what, when, and how without external influences.

The [Scrum Master](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master) is accountable for maintaining Scrum. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization while serving the Scrum Team as well as the larger organization. 

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product of the Scrum Team. The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management.

The Developer team is not necessarily team of software developers. They do any type of product work whether software or not and any aspect of helping to design, build, test or ship the product.

## Sprints

<img src="https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/inline-images/2023-10/the-sprint-2.png" />

The [Sprint](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints) is the heart of Scrum. It is a short time-boxed period (typically 2 to 4 weeks) where the scrum team works to complete an agreed-upon amount of work. At the end of each sprint, **increments** of work are delivered to the stackholders and the sprint cycle begins anew. 

Each sprint has artifacts and events that it follows to complete the cycle. These artifacts and events allow the team to setup the cadence and to determine what work will be done for the sprint.


The first event is called [Sprint Planning](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning) and it is where the team would discuss what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how the work will be done. The team would take a look at the **Product Backlog** and determine what user stories are to be take for the sprint. This will then form the **Sprint Backlog**. 

A **product backlog** is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the product roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. 

The **sprint backlog** is a plan by and for the Developer team. It is a real-time picture of the work that the team plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.

The next event is the [Daily Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum) which happens at the same time every working day of the Sprint. throughout the sprint. It is a short 15-minute discussion with the entire team where each member would only discuss 3 items:
1. What was done the previous daily.
2. What are the plans for today.
3. What are the blockers and hurdles encountered, if any.

At the end of each sprint, the [Sprint Review](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-reviews) takes place. In the review, the team and stakeholders gather to review and demonstrate the work completed during the sprint. 

This provides an opportunity to showcase the features developed, gather feedback, and ensure alignment with the product vision and requirements.

The last scrum event is called the **Sprint Retrospective**  gives the team the opportunity to review the latest sprint and make improvements for future sprints. These meetings are essential because regularly assessing and improving processes leads to quality results and fewer obstacles. The meeting typically discusses 3 main points:
1. What can be improved (Start)
2. What didn't go well (Stop)
3. What went well (Continue)

## Managing Tasks

### User Stories

A user story is an statement of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to describe how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories are often expressed as "persona / role + need + purpose.": `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`

After creating the user stories, acceptance criteria for each story must be created. Acceptance criteria are defined as the conditions that must be satisfied for a product, user story, or increment of work to be accepted. 

Example:
**Given** user enter correct username admin123 And incorrect password password123:

**When** user press “Login” button

**Then** an error message should display “Login failed, please try again.”

Typically it follows the format: Given - When - Then. This allows for developers to simulate the flow and behavior of the end users which is the basis for BDD or Behavior-Driven Development. It is when an application and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

### Story points

After the user stories and acceptance criteria have been written and discussed with the team, they will be prioritized and give story points. A story point describes the complexity of user stories.

Typically, stories are given the following points:
- 1 point - least complexity
- 3 point - moderate complexity
- 5 point - high complexity
- 8 point - story is too huge to complete within a sprint and it should be broken down into several user stories.

>Why not man hours? Two developers will give two different set of man hours based on their experiences and familiarity of the project. Both developers should agree upon the level of complexity of user stories. Therefore, using user stories avoid dispute over the actual effort needed to finish the task

Another factor to consider is how can we achieve deadline predictability?
- Velocity is the number of story points cleared per sprint
- Over several sprints, we should know the average velocity and use that for deadline predictability
- Manpower x story points cleared = business estimation
