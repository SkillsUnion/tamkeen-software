# What is JavaScript

JavaScript bears no resembalance to the language `Java`, other than some superficial syntax similarities to a shared ancestor language, `C`. The name was mostly a marketing descision.

It was famously created in about a week by Brendan Eich, who was working at the first browser company, Netscape.

JavaScript is not a terribly well-regarded language, but has become popular because it is the **only** language of the web browser. Any and every single web browser created must run the JavaScript language, which has made it a powerhouse in terms of ubiquity. In fact, it's relatively rare for a single language to dominate a such diverse and widespread platform such as the web browser.
