# Node.js

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the role and importance of Node.js in full-stack JavaScript development
2. Demonstrate the ability to use the Node.js console for executing JavaScript command
3. Execute JavaScript files using Node.js from the command line
4. Demonstrate how to install Nodemon globally using npm
5. Show how to use Nodemon to automatically restart a Node.js application when file changes are detected

## Introduction

Node.js (Node for short) is a JavaScript "runtime" that runs JS on our computers (as opposed to a user's browser). Node is popular because it enables SWEs to build both frontends and backends in JS, which has simplified feature development, attracted more developers to JS, and resulted in a large number of JS libraries available for both frontend and backend.

You can download npm in its [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).

## Warmup: Node console in command line

To warm up with Node, run the following command on the command line.

```bash
node
```

This should open a JS console on the command line similar to the Chrome DevTools console. We can test JS syntax in this console similar to how we might in Chrome.

```
% node
Welcome to Node.js v16.14.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
> a = [1,2,3]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
> b = [4,5,6]
[ 4, 5, 6 ]
> a+b
'1,2,34,5,6'
> a.concat(b)
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```

Type `Ctrl+D` to exit, which sends an "end of file" signal to Node to close the program.

## Run JS files with Node

Node is primarily used to run JS files. Try running the following `index.js` file with Node.

```javascript
console.log("hello world");
```

```bash
node index.js
```

## Nodemon

[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is an application that restarts our Node app every time we change a file that the app depends on. This is especially useful in development when we make frequent changes to our code. Without Nodemon we would need to manually quit and restart our app on code changes.

## Usage

1.  Install Nodemon globally to run Nodemon from all folders.

    ```
    npm i -g nodemon
    ```
2.  Run `nodemon` on the entry file of our app. When any app files changes, Nodemon will restart the app.

    ```
    nodemon index.js
    ```
